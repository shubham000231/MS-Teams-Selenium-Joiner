  Selenium script to automatically join Microsoft Teams meetings.<br>
  Automatically turns off your microphone and camera before joining.<br>
  Automatic login and blacklist can be set in the config file.  
  Always joins the newest meeting <br>
  Leaves either after a specified time, if you are the last person in the meeting or only if a new one is available<br>

## Configuration options  
  
- **email/password:**  
The email/password of your Microsoft account (can be left empty if you don't want to automatically login)  

- **run_at_time:**  
Time to start the script at. Input is a string of the hour and minute in 24h format, if you want it to start immediately leave this empty. 
If a time before the current time is given, the next day is used. Also make sure that "start_automatically" is set to true and that 
you entered your email and password.  
For example, if you want the script to start searching meetings at 6 in the morning on the next day, you would input `06:00` in the config.

- **start_automatically:**  
If true, skips the `Start [s], Reload teams [r], Quit [q]` dialog and starts on it's own. Useful if you schedule the script to start at a specific time.  

- **organisation_num:**     
If your Teams account is in multiple organisations, as seen in the example below, change the organisation_num to the number of the list item (counting starts from 1)

- **random_delay:**  
If true, adds a random delay (10s-30s) before joining a meeting. Can be useful so the bot seems more "human like".  

- **check_interval:**  
The amount of seconds to wait before checking for meetings again. Only integer numbers greater than 1 are allowed.

- **auto_leave_after_min:**  
If set to a value greater than zero, the bot leaves every meeting after the specified time (in minutes). Useful if you know the length of your meeting, if this is left a the default the bot will stay in the meeting until a new one is available.

- **leave_if_last:**  
If true, leaves the meeting if you are the last person in it.

- **headless:**     
If true, runs Chrome in headless mode (does not open GUI window and runs in background).

- **mute_audio:**     
If true, mutes all the sounds.

- **chrome_type:**     
Valid options: `google-chrome`, `chromium`, `msedge`. By default, google chrome is used, but the script can also be used with Chromium or Microsoft Edge.

- **blacklist:**  
A list of Teams and their channels to ignore. Meetings ocurring in these channels will not be joined.  
If you have a Team called "Test1" and, within that, two channels called "General" and "Channel1" and you don't want to join meetings in the "General" Channel: 
```json
"blacklist": [  
  {  
    "team_name": "Test1",  
    "channel_names": [  
      "General"
    ]  
  }
]
```

## Run the script  
  
 1. Rename the [config.json.example](config.json.example) file to "config.json"  
 2. Edit the "config.json" file to fit your preferences (optional)  
 3. Install Selenium and webdriver_manager
 4. Run [auto_joiner.py](auto_joiner.py): `python auto_joiner.py`  
 
## Problems with the script 
  
 1. Might join wrong meeting if more than one class is running simultaneouslyüò¢
 2. If there is a possiblity of continuation of class after the scheduled duration auto_leave_after_min option is not recommendedü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 3. Professor ne kuch puch liya toh ghanta kuch nhi kr skteüòÇ
